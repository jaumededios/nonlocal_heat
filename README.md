# Study of experimental devices to detect non-local difusion of heat.

A while ago (summer 2017) I worked on a lab where I designed experimental devices to measure discrepancies between the fourier heat conduction model and heat conduction at the nanoscale. Given plausible alternative hypothesis from the nonequilibrium statistical physics literature, we designed experiments that maximized the expected discrepancies between the models.

This experimental method should in principle increase the discrepancy between both models by more than an order of magnitude from the state of the art. Since the results are not yet published (some of the experimental work is being performed at the moment) I cannot show the full schematics of the optimised devices yet, but I will soon!
